Generic-C-Data-Structures

    A C project to create Generic Dynamic Data-structures for the C Programmer.
I plan to add more structures as this project grows.  The structures will use
void pointers to allow for them to operate as generically, so it will be ideal to
apply appropriate casting when retrieving data from the data structures.

Current working structures are as follows:
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Queue
